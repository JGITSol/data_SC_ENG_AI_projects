# Simulated Physics 2: Spring-Mass Systems

## Overview
Simulation of harmonic oscillators including single and coupled spring-mass systems, demonstrating resonance, normal modes, and damping effects.

## Features
- Single spring-mass oscillator
- Coupled oscillator systems
- Damped and driven oscillations
- Resonance frequency analysis
- Normal mode decomposition

## Physics Concepts
- Hooke's Law (F = -kx)
- Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)
- Damped oscillations
- Forced oscillations and resonance
- Coupled systems and normal modes

## Key Equations
- `x'' + 2γx' + ω₀²x = F(t)/m` (driven damped oscillator)
- `ω₀ = √(k/m)` (natural frequency)
- `Q = ω₀/(2γ)` (quality factor)

## Installation
