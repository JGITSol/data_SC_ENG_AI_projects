# Simulated Physics 5: Wave Propagation

## Overview
Advanced simulation of wave phenomena including electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves, and quantum wave functions using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods.

## Features
- 1D and 2D wave equation solutions
- Standing waves and interference
- Diffraction and refraction
- Dispersion relations
- Wave packet evolution
- Schrödinger equation for quantum waves

## Physics Concepts
- Wave equation: `∂²ψ/∂t² = c²∇²ψ`
- Superposition principle
- Boundary conditions and reflections
- Dispersion and group velocity
- Quantum mechanical waves

## Key Equations
- `∂²ψ/∂t² = c²∂²ψ/∂x²` (1D wave equation)
- `iℏ∂ψ/∂t = -ℏ²/2m ∇²ψ + Vψ` (Schrödinger equation)
- `v_g = ∂ω/∂k` (group velocity)
