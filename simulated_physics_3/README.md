# Simulated Physics 3: Orbital Mechanics

## Overview
Simulation of planetary orbits, satellite trajectories, and gravitational N-body problems using Newton's law of universal gravitation.

## Features
- Two-body orbital mechanics
- Elliptical, circular, and hyperbolic orbits
- N-body gravitational simulations
- Orbit stability analysis
- Energy and angular momentum conservation

## Physics Concepts
- Newton's law of gravitation
- Kepler's laws of planetary motion
- Orbital elements (eccentricity, semi-major axis)
- Gravitational potential energy
- Two-body and N-body problems

## Key Equations
- `F = GMm/r²` (gravitational force)
- `v = √(GM/r)` (orbital velocity for circular orbit)
- `T² ∝ a³` (Kepler's third law)

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
